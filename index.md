I am a master's student in the **[IPCV lab, IIT Madras](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ipcvlab/)**. I am advised by **[Prof. Rajagopalan. A. N.](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~raju/)** specializing on topics related to Computer Vision.  I received my Bachelor's Degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from **[PES University, Bengaluru](https://pes.edu/)** in the year 2020. My research lies at the intersection of Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Multimodal learning. My recent works have focused on improving the vision-language models accuracy on the downstream tasks. I have worked on developing and utilizing the non-linear frame sampling strategy to improve the task of text-to-video retrieval with multimodal models. I have also worked on the problem such as improving the Visual Question Answering (VQA) on the data-scarce datasets with the help of vision-language models.
